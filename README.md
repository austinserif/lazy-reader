### Lazy-Reader
##### @austinserif

#### Summary
The purpose of this library is to provide light-weight methods for building entity-relationship profiles using the spaCy[https://spacy.io/] natural language processing API. Lazy-Reader takes a series of keyword inputs and searches for articles related to those keywords, recursively building entity-profiles and assigning bias scores based on the number and diversity of parsed articles.

#### Documentation
Coming Soon!

#### Tests
To run tests for profile and article classes
